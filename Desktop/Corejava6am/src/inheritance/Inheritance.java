	 * =============== Inheritance =============
	 * # code re-usability 
	 * # process of accessing properties and methods of parent/super/base class to child/sub/derived class is known as inheritance.
	 * 
	 * # Also known as Is-A relationship 
	 * # Its a generalization to specialization process.
	 * # 'extends' keyword is used in inheritance
	 * # we can inherit only one class at a time.(no multiple parent)
	 * # we can't inherit private properties and method.
	 * # we can't inherit constructor.
	 * # we can inherit static variables and methods.
	 * 
	 * syntax:
	 *   
	 *   class child_class extends parent_class{
	 *   
	 *        //properties : parent + child
	 *        
	 *        //method : parent + child
	 *   
	 *   }
	 *   
	 *   e.g.
	 *    
	 *    //Multi Level
	 *    
	 *    class A{ //grandfather
	 *    
	 *    }
	 *    
	 *    class B extends A{  //father

	 *    }
