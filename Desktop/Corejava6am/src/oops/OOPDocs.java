	 * ================ Class ================
	 * # use to represent real world things/entity.
	 * # class contains properties and methods.
	 * # it's a blue print/template of object. (conceptual visualization)
	 * # also known as reference data type or user defined data type.
	 * # its a collection/group of object having similar behaviors.

	 * syntax:
	 *  
	 *  class class_name{

	 *      
	 *     }
	 *=============== Object =================
	 * # implementation of class is object.
	 * # instance of class and Vs(vice-versa).
	 * # object contains instance variables and instance methods.
	 * # object holds memory when it's created.
	 *  -> size of object = number of instance variable created.
